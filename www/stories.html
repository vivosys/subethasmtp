<!-- The class h2 is included on the main div, because the HTML which the
     server will wrap around the page includes a <div class="h2">.
     Thus, we include one here so that the page looks right when previewed
     locally, *but* we override the border which the CSS assigns to that
     style, so that we do not get two borders on the live page. -->

We systematically test service providers to publish objective reports
on reliability, performance, and customer service at <a href="http://www.realmetrics.com">www.realmetrics.com</a>.
We'll be launching a new Email Hosting category soon where we systematically
test email hosts by sending emails frequently and measuring the % delivered
(ideally 100% always) and measure the time it takes to deliver the message.
We have five monitoring servers distributed around the country sending these
emails and we are running the SubEthaSMTP server to receive the emails.  We
are currently gathering data on the email hosting providers and plan to
launch the new Email Hosting category soon.  <strong>We'll be sending about 1.5
million emails through SubEthaSMTP every month (all from/to our own
domains).</strong> --Kent Johnson (Co-Founder & Chief Technology Officer @ RealMetrics)
