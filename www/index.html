	<h2>SubEthaSMTP Mail Server</h2>
	
	<p>
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-Etha">SubEtha</a>SMTP is
		a easy to understand Java library which provides a receptive 
		SMTP server component. By plugging this component into your 
		Java application, you can easily receive SMTP mail using a simple 
		abstract Java interface.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		This component can be used in almost any kind of email 
		processing application.  Hypothetical (and not-so hypothetical)
		uses include:
	</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>A mailing list manager (ie, <a href="http://subetha.tigris.org/">SubEtha Mail</a>)</li>
		<li>A mail server that delivers mail to user inboxes</li>
		<li>A mail archiver like <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/">Mail Archive</a></li>
		<li>An email test harness (Implemented in this project. It's called <a href="wiser.html">Wiser</a>.)</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>
		SubEthaSMTP's simple, low-level API is suitable for writing almost
		any kind of mail-receiving application.
	</p>
	
	<h2>A Little History</h2>
	
	<p>
		SubEthaSMTP was split out of the
		<a href="http://subetha.tigris.org/">SubEtha Mail</a> mailing
		list manager because it is a useful standalone component.  When
		we wrote SubEtha, the last thing we wanted to do was write our
		own SMTP server.  In our search for a modular Java SMTP component,
		we examined:
	</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li><a href="http://james.apache.org/">Apache JAMES</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://labs.jboss.com/portal/jbossmail/index.html">JBoss Mail Server</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://quintanasoft.com/dumbster/">Dumbster</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://www.jsmtpd.org/site/">Jsmtpd</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://www.ericdaugherty.com/java/mailserver/">JES</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://jmailsrv.sourceforge.net/">Java Mail Server</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://www.icegreen.com/greenmail/">Green Mail</a></li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>
		Since you're reading this page you probably already know what we found:
		Seven different SMTP implementations without the slightest thought
		given to reusability. Even Jstmpd, which purports to be a "A Modular
		Java SMTP Daemon", isn't.  Even though JBoss Mail is in
		active development, the team was unintersted in componentization of the
		SMTP processing portion of their server. GreenMail, which is based on 
		the JAMES code base is best summarized with this 
		<a href="http://eokyere.blogspot.com/2006/10/get-wiser-with-subethasmtp.html">blog posting</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
		During the development of SubEtha's testing harness, we tried out
		the <a href="http://quintanasoft.com/dumbster/">Dumbster</a> software 
		and found that not only was the API difficult to use, it did it not work 
		properly, the developer has not done any development on it in about a 
		year and it does not work reliably on Mac OS X. With two simple classes
		we re-implemented it as an included project called <a href="wiser.html">Wiser</a>.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		We hate reinventing wheels.  This should be the LAST FREAKING JAVA
		SMTP IMPLEMENTATION.
	</p>

	<h2>Project Authors</h2>
	
	<p>
		Ian McFarland contributed the first codebase to SubEtha Mail. Then, Jon Stevens
		and Jeff Schnitzer re-wrote most of Ian's code into what we have today. Edouard De Oliveira
		re-wrote the network layer to use <a href="http://mina.apache.org/">Apache Mina</a> to provide
		Native IO (NIO) support.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Project Status</h2>
	
	<p>
		This application is as feature complete as we need it right now. 
		There are zero known issues (and when they do crop up, we fix them 
		as quickly as possible). It can be used in production environments today.
		Enjoy. =)
	</p>

	<h2>User Stories</h2>
	<p>
		Open source always provides one great mystery. Who are your users? Many
		people often enjoy our hard work for years and we have no idea who they
		are or how they are using the software. So, we have created a page that
		we hope you will help contribute to. It's called User Stories...
	</p>
	
	<p>
		On <a href="stories.html">this page</a>, we have a collection of people 
		who have emailed us with a description of how they use SubEthaSMTP in 
		their every day lives. We would love to hear from you as well. Send a message
		to our <a href="project_lists.html">mailing list</a>.
	</p>

	<h2>How To Get It</h2>
	
	<p>
		Head on down to the <a href="http://subethasmtp.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectDocumentList">Downloads section</a> or get the source code from 
		our <a href="http://subethasmtp.tigris.org/source/browse/subethasmtp/">Subversion repository</a>.
	</p>
	
	<h2>How To Use It</h2>
	
	<p>
		SubEthaSMTP and <a href="wiser.html">Wiser</a> depends on commons-logging.jar, 
		mail.jar/activation.jar. For your convenience, these jar files are 
		included in the distribution.
	</p>

	<p>
		Using SubEthaSMTP is trivial:
	</p>
	
<pre>List&lt;MessageListener&gt; listeners = new ArrayList&lt;MessageListener&gt;();
listeners.add(myListener);
SMTPServer smtpServer = new SMTPServer(listeners);
smtpServer.start();</pre>
	
	<p>
		The MessageListener is easy to implement:
	</p>
	
<pre>public interface MessageListener
{
	/**
	 * Called once for every RCPT TO during a SMTP exchange.
	 */
	public boolean accept(String from, String recipient);

	/**
	 * When message data arrives, this method will be called for every recipient
	 * this listener accepted.
	 */
	public void deliver(String from, String recipient, InputStream data)
			throws TooMuchDataException, IOException;
}</pre>
	
	<p>
		Your listener simply accept()s any recipients it cares about, and
		the SMTP server will deliver() an input stream of the message data.
		Any recipients which are not accepted by a listener will be rejected.
	</p>

	<p>
		Take a look at the <a href="http://subethasmtp.tigris.org/source/browse/*checkout*/subethasmtp/trunk/wiser/src/org/subethamail/wiser/Wiser.java">source code</a> for <a href="wiser.html">Wiser</a> 
		to see a simple example of how to implement MessageListener.deliver() so that 
		it receives a message and converts it into a JavaMail MimeMessage object.
		This should make it very easy to add to your application the ability 
		to receive and process email.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Additional Server Control</h2>
	
	<p>
		As an alternative to the simple MessageListener interface, we have a slightly more 
		complicated way of creating a SMTPServer that involves the creation of a class that
		implements MessageHandler and another class that implements MessageHandlerFactory.
		Take a look at the MessageListenerAdapter for an example of how to use these interfaces.
		When using the SMTPServer with the MessageListener interface, it actually creates a
		MessageListenerAdapter under the covers.
	</p>

	<p>
		SubEtha SMTP now supports the SMTP AUTH commands. PLAIN and LOGIN are included as part 
		of the distribution. The implementation of AUTH is done with a pluggable implementation 
		so that you can write your own backend authentication handler. Please see the 
		org.tigris.smtp.auth package for more information. The unit tests also contain example 
		usage.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Performance and Security</h2>
	
	<p>
		SubEthaSMTP is fully multithreaded. For the fastest possible networking, 
		it uses <a href="http://mina.apache.org/">Apache Mina</a> to provide NIO based
		stream handling. This should be one of the fastest Java SMTP receivers on the 
		planet.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		SubEthaSMTP handles streams efficiently:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			If only one listener accept()s a message, the network
			InputStream (filtered to remove SMTP protocol bits) is
			handed to the listener.
		</li>
		<li>
			If more than one listener accept()s a message, the
			message data is first buffered.  The buffer will be
			kept in RAM until the data reaches a certain size
			(the default is 5 megs and is configurable by instantiating
			your own MessageListenerAdapter or implemeting your own 
			MessageHandlerFactory, then the buffer is moved to a 
			temporary disk file. Each listener will be delivered 
			a complete copy of the buffered message.
		</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>
		Java by it's nature should be immune to buffer-overflow attacks.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Support</h2>

	<p>
		If you have any bug reports, questions or comments about SubEtha SMTP, it's best that
		you bring these issues up on the 
		<a href="http://subethasmtp.tigris.org/project_lists.html">Mailing Lists</a> and
		not email the authors directly.
	</p>

	<h2>Spec Compliance</h2>

	<p>
		For now, we have just focused on implementing just the minimal 
		required aspects of <a href="http://rfc.net/rfc2821.html#s4.5.1" target="_new">RFC 2821</a>.
		We also return SMTP status responses that mimic what Postfix returns.
		However we do not directly support the 'postmaster' requirement of the 
		RFC since we do not actually deliver mail locally. That's your job as 
		the user of this library by implementing the MessageListener 
		interface. =)
