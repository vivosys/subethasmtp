 * The interface that defines the conversational exchange of a single message
 * on an SMTP connection.  The methods will be called in the following order:
 * 
 * <ol>
 * <li><code>from()</code></li>
 * <li><code>recipient()</code> (possibly more than once)</li>
 * <li><code>data()</code></li>
 * </ol>
 * 
 * If multiple messages are delivered on a single connection (ie, using the RSET command)
 * then multiple message handlers will be instantiated.  Each handler services one
 * and only one message.
